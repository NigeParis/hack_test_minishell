# 42-minishell

A long project at 42 in a group of two, the goal is to create  <br> 
a command interpreter that mimics the behavior of bash. <br> 

Minishell manages environment variables, launches programs and handles their return. <br> 
There are also have a number of built-in functions: <br> 

### TODO

  Commands execution and 'simple' argument parsing 
 - [x] /bin/ls should be the same as ls
 - [x] ./exec should work

  History of command line
 - [x] History (Arrow up, Arrow down)
 - [x] line edit (Arrow right, Arrow left) echo

  Quote and double quotes (simple)
 - [x] '\'ls -l\'' shouldn't be the same as 'ls -l' (no quotes)
 - [x] 'ls -l' should be the same as 'ls        -l'
 - [x] 'ls -l' should be the same as 'ls "-l"'
 - [x] 'ls -l' should be the same as 'ls '-l''
 - [x] 'ls -l' should not be the same as 'ls \'-l \''

  Multiple commands execution on single line
 - [ ] cmd1 ';' cmd2   (not asked for in Mandatory or Bonus)

  Quote and double quotes (hard)
 - [x] nested quotes and double quotes
 - [x] \\ character nullifies the quote end or start

  Built-ins (sorted by priority)(simple)
 - [x] echo (with -n)
 - [x] pwd with no options or arguments
 - [x] cd (handling of ~, '-', and no args)
 - [x] exit (args aka return code otherwise last cmd exec otherwise 0)
 - [x] env with no options or arguments
 - [x] export with no options
 - [x] unset with no options
  
  Redirection (simple)
 - [ ] '|' '>' '>>' '<' '>'
 - [ ] redirection simple with no duplicates of redirections or chaining
       ex :
       'ls > file' pipes the result of ls to file and truncates file
       'ls < file' pipes the contents of file to ls as stdin
       'ls | wc' pipes the result of ls to wc as stdin
       'ls >> file' pipes the result of ls to file in appends mode
       'ls > file' pipes stdout to file and prints stdout to stdout
       
  Variable substitution (simple)
 - [ ] $Field

  Subshell (simple if the rest is done)CTRL+z (SIGTSTP) (Bonus) echo
 - [x] execute ( cmd ) in subshell (good test (cd))

  Signal handling (simple)
 - [!] CTRL + C sigint (extra message - to be removed)
 - [X] CTRL + D eof
 - [x] CTRL + \ sigquit

  Redirection (hard)
 - [ ] any fd plus > or < or >>
    - [ ] redirections of stdout and stderr
        ex :
        'ls 2> file' pipes stderr to file
        'ls 2> file1 1> file2' pipes stderr to file1 and stdout to file2
 - [x] redirect cmd to previous decl redirection
       e.g. >&fd redirect stdout to the same redirection as fd currently has.
       'ls > file >&1' pipes stdout to file and then pipes stderr to redirected stdout.
       'ls >&1 > file' pipes stderr to redirection of stdout and then pipes stdout to file.
 - [x] redirections should be able to be chained
       'ls > file1 > file2' results in stdout being redirected to file2

  Variable substitution (hard)
 - [ ] single line variables 
    ex:
        'let a=5; echo $a' should print 5 even if a is declared on the same line
 - [ ] subshell substitution $( cmd1 )

  Signal handling (hard)
 - [ ] all other signals. (not asked for in Mandatory or Bonus)
 - [ ] CTRL + Z sigtstp  (not asked for in Mandatory or Bonus)

  Norme
 - [ ] Norminette OK <br>
  Leak
 - [ ] Valgrind OK
    - [ ] on normal lines
    - [ ] on error lines
