:: MINISHELL SCOPE ::

:: GOAL ::

Commands execution and 'simple' argument parsing
- /bin/ls should be the same as ls
- ./exec should work

quote and double quotes (simple)
- '\'ls -l\'' shouldn't be the same as 'ls -l' (no quotes)
- 'ls -l' should be the same as 'ls        -l'
- 'ls -l' should be the same as 'ls "-l"'
- 'ls -l' should be the same as 'ls '-l''
- 'ls -l' should not be the same as 'ls \'-l \''

Multiple commands execution on single line
- cmd1 ';' cmd2

quote and double quotes (hard)
- nested quotes and double quotes
- \\ character nullifies the quote end or start

Built-ins (sorted by priority)(simple)
- echo (with -n)
- pwd (no args)
- cd (handling of ~, '-', and no args)
- exit (args aka return code otherwise last cmd exec otherwise 0)
- env (-i, -u)
- export
- unset

Redirection (simple)
- '|' '>' '>>' '<' '2>'
- redirection simple with no duplicates of redirections or chaining
	a.k.a.
	 'ls > file' pipes the result of ls to file and truncates file
	 'ls < file' pipes the contents of file to ls as stdin
	 'ls | wc' pipes the result of ls to wc as stdin
	 'ls >> file' pipes the result of ls to file and appends to file
	 'ls 2> file' pipes stderr to file and prints stdout to stdout

Variable substitution (simple)
- $Field

Subshell (simple if the rest is done)
- execute ( cmd ) in subshell (good test (cd))

Signal handling (simple)
- CTRL + C sigint
- CTRL + D eof
- CTRL + \ sigquit

Redirection (hard)
- any fd plus > or < or >>
- redirect cmd to previous decl redirection 
	e.g. >&fd redirect stdout to the same redirection as fd currently has.
	'ls > file 2>&1' pipes stdout to file and then pipes stderr to redirected stdout.
	'ls 2>&1 > file' pipes stderr to redirection of stdout and then pipes stdout to file.
- redirections should be able to be chained
	'ls > file1 > file2' results in stdout being redirected to file2

Variable substitution (hard)
- single line variables 
- subshell substitution $( cmd1 )

Signal handling (hard)
- all other signals. (Bonus)
-   CTRL+z (SIGTSTP) (Bonus)
-	
that's it. That's the tasks, all of them.

Built-ins (hard)
- any shell utility you like/find useful. (Bonus)
